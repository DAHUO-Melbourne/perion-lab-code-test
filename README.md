- you might see error message if your steam id doesn't exist, then you need to go back to previous page to re input your correct steam id:

## Bonus cool feature enhancement:

### Filter and get all unplayed games:
According to my own personal experience, I have more than 200 games, and I know I haven't played some of them before. But I don't know what are the games I haven't played before
So I added a filter checkbox here to pick up all the games I haven't before, and I believe this function is very helpful because I find there is no similar function as I just mentioned.
